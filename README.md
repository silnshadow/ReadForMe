ReadForMe is a Python script that uses text-to-speech to read out text from a PDF file. It can be used to read books, articles, and other written content without having to visually read the text. This can be helpful for people with visual impairments or for anyone who wants to listen to content while doing other tasks.

Installation

Clone the repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/silnshadow/ReadForMe.git```

Install the required dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Navigate to the ReadForMe directory in your terminal.

Run the script with the following command:

```
python read_for_me.py --file path/to/your/file.pdf
```
This will read out the text from the PDF file.

You can also specify the speed of the voice and the voice type using the --speed and --voice options:

```
python read_for_me.py --file path/to/your/file.pdf --speed 120 --voice en-US-Standard-D
This will read out the text at a speed of 120 words per minute using the en-US-Standard-D voice.
```
